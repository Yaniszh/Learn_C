 * Abstract:
 * Exercise 8-4. The standard library function
 *   int fseek(FILE *fp, long offset, int origin)
 * is identical to lseek except that fp is a file pointer instead of a file descriptor and return value is an int
 * status, not a position. Write fseek. Make sure that your fseek coordinates properly with the buffering done
 * for the other functions of the library.

/*
 * int fseek(FILE *stream, long offset, int origin)
 *      fseek sets the file position for stream; a subsequent read or write will access data beginning at the
 *      new position. For a binary file, the position is set to offset characters from origin, which may be
 *      SEEK_SET (beginning), SEEK_CUR (current position), or SEEK_END (end of file). For a text
 *      stream, offset must be zero, or a value returned by ftell (in which case origin must be
 *      SEEK_SET). fseek returns nonâˆ’zero on error.
